# Login Prompt Task

This project involves creating a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter their username and password. If the password is not correct, the user is prompted to try again until they get it right, with a maximum of 5 attempts. If the user enters the correct password, an alert is shown welcoming the user. If the password is incorrect after 5 attempts, an alert informs the user to try again later.

## Features

- Prompt the user to enter their username and password.
- Validate the entered password.
- Allow up to 5 attempts to enter the correct password.
- Show a welcome alert if the password is correct.
- Inform the user to try again later after 5 incorrect attempts.
- **Note:** This project uses CSS animation to show the welcome page, with help from a site called CodePen.

## How it works

1. The user is prompted to enter their username.
2. The user is then prompted to enter their password.
3. If the password is correct (`123`), an alert displays a welcome message.
4. If the password is incorrect, the user is prompted to try again.
5. The user has a maximum of 5 attempts to enter the correct password.
6. If the user fails to enter the correct password after 5 attempts, an alert informs them to try again later.
